“Why have you come here?”
Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small
cry of shock.
“Mr. Lovegood — what’s that?”
She was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike
that of a unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding
several feet into the room.
“It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius.
“No it isn’t!” said Hermione.
“Hermione,” muttered Harry, embarrassed, “now’s not the
moment —”
“But Harry, it’s an Erumpent horn! It’s a Class B Tradeable
Material and it’s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a
house!”
“How d’you know it’s an Erumpent horn?” asked Ron, edging
away from the horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter
of the room.
“There’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them!
Mr. Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don’t you know
it can explode at the slightest touch?”
“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius very clearly,
a mulish look upon his face, “is a shy and highly magical creature,
and its horn —”
“Mr. Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings around the
base, that’s an Erumpent horn and it’s incredibly dangerous — I
don’t know where you got it —”
